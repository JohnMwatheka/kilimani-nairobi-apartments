        <h2>Nairobi City  </h2>
        <p>Nairobi is the capital of the country of Kenya. It is the main city of eastern Africa. It was named after a watering hole that was in the area before the city was built. The Masai people called the watering hole Enkare Nairobi, which means &ldquo;cold water.&rdquo; Many of Kenya&rsquo;s businesses and industries are located in Nairobi. Factories in the city make food products, drinks, cigarettes, furniture, and other goods. Many people in Nairobi work for the railways. Goods are loaded on trains in the city and transported to Mombasa, Kenya&rsquo;s main seaport. Tourism is also important to the economy of Nairobi. Many tourists visit Nairobi National Park, which lies just outside the city. It is a large and beautiful nature park where wild animals are protected. The park is home to lions, giraffes, rhinoceroses, zebras, and many kinds of birds. In the late 1800s Great Britain began taking over much of eastern Africa. Nairobi was founded in the late 1890s. It began as a settlement along a railway built by the British. In 1905 the British made Nairobi their capital in eastern Africa. Nairobi soon grew into a large city. In 1963 Kenya became an independent country with Nairobi as its capital. Population (2009 census), 3,138,369.</p>

        <h2>Getting to Nairobi</h2>
        <p class="py-1 my-2 text-justify mr-2 ml-2">
          The main way that most international visitors get to Nairobi is by flying into the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO), Kenya&rsquo;s main international airport. But you can also reach Nairobi by train, car, or bus. By Plane The main airport in Nairobi is Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO). It is likely that this is where you&rsquo;ll be arriving into Kenya. if you are arriving from elsewhere in Kenya or East Africa, your flight may arrive at the smaller <strong>Nairobi Wilson Airport in Nairobi. </strong>To get from the Nairobi airport to your Nairobi Apartments, you can take a taxi, a shared shuttle bus, an Uber, or book a private transfer, we recommend booking your airport transfer in advance as it tends to be the most hassle-free way. If you decide to take a taxi, be sure to set a clear price with the driver before agreeing to the trip. Or consider booking an Uber in advance. By Train Currently, the railway system in Kenya only connects a small area of Kenya, mainly the cities of Nairobi and <strong>Mombasa</strong>. So, the main travelers arriving by train into Nairobi are those who are arriving into Mombasa by plane or ship. Historically, Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya were connected by train but the rail connections have been closed for many years.

        <h4>Nairobi Taxis and Ride Sharing Apps</h4>
        <p><strong>Nairobi Taxis</strong> and ride shares are very popular ways for visitors to get around Nairobi. Although more expensive than public transit, these tend to be easier, safer, and more comfortable. <strong>Taxis in Nairobi</strong> can usually be found waiting at the airports, train stations, street corners in the city center, and also around popular hotels, tourist sites, and shopping centers. Licensed taxis in Nairobi are either yellow or marked with a yellow stripe. Just note that many don&rsquo;t use meters so you will want to agree on a price before you get in the taxi.</p>

        <h3><span style="font-size: 20.0pt; line-height: 107%; color: windowtext;">Nairobi Weather </span></h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The average annual temperature is around 66&deg; F (18.5&deg; C). Daytime temperatures rarely go below 50&deg; F (10&deg; C) or above 85&deg; F (29&deg; C). February and March are typically the hottest months in Nairobi with an average temperature of 69&deg; F (20.5&deg; C) and the coldest months are July and August with an average temperature of 62&deg; F (16.5&deg;C). Kenya has two rainy seasons, from March to May and from October to December. The rainiest month is April with a lot of rain also typical in May and November. So, you&rsquo;ll definitely want to be prepared for rain if visiting during the rainy season, but we&rsquo;d recommend being prepared for rain no matter when you visit. Nairobi is a city you can visit any time of the year. The weather is pretty temperate throughout the year, being warm during the days and cool at night. Most attractions in the city are open year-round to visitors.</p>
        <h4>How to Dress in Nairobi</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">We recommend wearing comfortable clothing in Nairobi that are suitable for the weather. It is often sunny in Nairobi so be sure to protect yourself from the sun and check the weather forecast for rain. It is important to respect the local culture and customs while in Kenya, which means wearing clothing that is more loose-fitting and conservative. This means avoiding really tight-fitting clothing or clothes that are short, show off your stomach, or expose a lot of skin. However, although Kenyans may wear more conservative styles, they love color and bold patterns! Now, while safari clothing and hiking boots are great to wear when on safari or hiking, we don&rsquo;t recommend wearing those clothes when visiting Nairobi (unless you are going to Nairobi National Park). We recommend wearing your regular travel clothes and leaving your safari clothing in your suitcase while exploring the city.</p>

        <h2>Nairobi National Park</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Nairobi National Park</strong> is unique as it is the only wildlife park located within a capital city. It is located just 10 km south of the downtown area of Nairobi. It is one of the few places in the world where you can spot animals with a city landscape in the background. Although a somewhat compact park, it has over 100 species of mammals. It has 4 of the Big Five animals; the park does not have any elephants. It has many of the animals that people come to Kenya to see, including lions, leopards, giraffes, zebra, cheetah, hyenas, rhinos, hippos, impala, baboons, and crocodiles. Over 400 bird species have been recorded here. If you plan to visit the park, we recommend going early and visiting in the morning. Many of the animals and birds are more active in the cooler morning hours. You can obviously see more if you have a full day. But if you just have half a day for visiting, we recommend choosing the morning rather than the afternoon to visit. You can drive your own vehicle or hire a guide. We highly recommend going with a driver guide who knows the park and in a proper safari vehicle with a pop-up roof. A good guide can really help you see more and better identify the animals and birds you do see.</p>
        <h3>Nairobi Giraffe Centre</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The Giraffe Centre is an educational center run by the non-profit organization African Fund for Endangered Wildlife (AFEW). The AFEW was founded in 1979 by Jock and Betty Leslie-Melville to try to save the Rothschild&rsquo;s giraffe through breeding, research, conservation, and education</p>
        <h3>Carnivore Restaurant</h3>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Carnivore </strong>is by far the most well-known restaurant in Nairobi and has become a popular tourist destination. It was opened in Nairobi in 1980 and offers an all-you-can-eat menu that is focused on roasted meats. <strong>Carnivore restaurant</strong> became famous for serving some pretty unusual and exotic wild game meats, but because wild game meat has since been outlawed in Kenya, all meat served here is now farmed. So you&rsquo;ll be offered typical meats like steak, leg of lamb, pork, and chicken, but there are also more unusual meats on offer like ostrich, crocodile, and bull testicles.</p>
        <h3>Nairobi Shopping Centers</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">If you are looking for general <strong>shopping in Nairobi</strong>, there are a lot of <strong>Nairobi shopping malls</strong> and <strong>shopping centers in Nairobi,</strong> including Y<strong>aya Centre</strong>, <strong>Westgate Shopping Centre</strong>, <strong>Sarit Centre,</strong> <strong>Village Market</strong>, <strong>Prestige Plaza</strong>, and <strong>The Junction Mall</strong>. Most are located in the wealthier suburban areas. Not only do these have a lot of stores and restaurants, but they also usually have supermarkets, banks, salons, pharmacies, movie theaters, and phone services as well.</p>
        <h3>Nairobi Karen Blixen Museum</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The <strong>Karen Blixen Museum</strong> is housed in the farmhouse where Danish author and coffee farmer Karen Blixen (pen name Isak Dinesen) lived from 1917 to 1931. The 19th-century bungalow-style house was built in 1912 by Swedish civil engineer &Aring;ke Sj&ouml;gren. It was purchased in 1917 by Karen and her husband Baron Bror von Blixen Fincke. They bought a total of 4,500 acres of land for their farm and coffee plantation</p>
        <h3>Nairobi National Park</h3>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Nairobi National Park</strong> is situated just a few kilometres outside the city. It's home to large herds of plains game like zebra, giraffe, wildebeest, buffalo and rhino as well as predators like lion and cheetah. Over 400 species of birds have been recorded here. You can go on the 'Nairobi Safari Walk'.</p>
        <h3>Nairobi Westlands</h3>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Westlands</strong> is the bustling <strong>nightlife </strong>district of Nairobi. Many restaurants and bars line busy <strong>Woodvale Grove</strong> and <strong>Mpaka Road</strong>. A popular option for first-time visitors is the Treehouse Club, patronized largely by ex-pats. Some of the local clubs in Nairobi can become overcrowded. There's generally good security about.</p>
        <h4>Nairobi Craft &amp; Souvenir Shops</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">If you are looking for local crafts and souvenir shopping, our top recommendation for a one-stop shopping destination is Utamaduni Shops located in western Nairobi. This place sells lots of crafts and souvenirs and has an onsite cafe. See our section on Utamaduni Shops for more info on visiting here. Another great option is Spinner&rsquo;s Web located in northern Nairobi.&nbsp;Spinner&rsquo;s Web is a great place to go if looking for higher-end crafts and souvenirs from local vendors. They sell handicrafts, pottery, home decor, jewelry, art, fashion accessories, and more. They also have a cafe.</p>
        <h4>The best time to visit Nairobi</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">Generally, for the best weather and sunshine, you should go in the dry season which is between June to September and December to February. This also means that it is peak season so prices may be slightly higher. Be sure to book in advance so you still get some good deals.&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>Nairobi Arboretum</h4>
        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Nairobi Arboretum</strong> is located along <strong>State house Road</strong> in the area of<strong> Kilimani, Nairobi, Kenya</strong>. <strong>Nairobi Arboretum</strong> was founded in 1907 by Mr. Batiscombe in a bid to try out new forestry trees. <strong>Nairobi Arboretum</strong> was later gazette as a national reserve in 1932 by the government and issuance of a title deed was later conducted by the commissioner of lands to the government in 1996. The Arboretum is 3 km from the <strong>Nairobi city</strong> centre. <strong>Nairobi Arboretum</strong> proximity to the <strong>Nairobi city centre</strong> makes it easily accessible on foot. To get to its main entrance, get onto State House Road near St Andrew&rsquo;s Church, go past St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, <strong>YMCA Nairobi Central</strong>, University of Nairobi Halls of residence, and past the Arboretum Drive junction. At the point where State House Road makes a sharp left turn, take the little road that goes straight ahead. The Nairobi Arboretum main entrance is about 300 m ahead. There&rsquo;s also a car park at the main entrance for vehicles.</p>
